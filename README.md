Sorting Products
Implement the following sorting algorithms to organize the products in the database
Merge Sort
Quick Sort
Heap Sort
Sort the products based on different criteria such as
Price (ascending)
Rating (descending)
Number of Reviews (descending)
For each sorting algorithm
Analyse the time and space complexity of each algorithm.
Discuss which algorithm is more efficient for large datasets and explain why.
Searching Products
Implement and compare the following searching algorithms
Binary Search
Linear Search
Use these algorithms to search for products based on
Product ID
Category
Price range (e.g., products between $100 and $500)
For each search algorithm
Analyse its efficiency in terms of time complexity.
Provide scenarios where each search method would be preferable.
Algorithm Analysis
Provide a detailed mathematical understanding of the time and space complexity of each sorting and searching algorithm used.
Perform both theoretical and empirical analysis (through testing) on your product database to demonstrate how each algorithm behaves with increasing product entries (e.g., 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 products).
Justify the selection of the most suitable sorting and searching algorithm for the given product data and platform scalability needs.
